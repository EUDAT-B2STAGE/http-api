#  The idea is to extend the original composer
# to add some init command to launch only the first time.

# After init data will be saved as volumes.
# Note: do not remove volumes from your docker environment!

# Instructions followed to extend the original composer:
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#example-use-case
# Paragraph: Administrative tasks

sql:
  volumes:
   - ./confs/pgs_init.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup-my-schema.sh:ro

icat:
  command: /init
  #command: sleep infinity    ## DEBUG
  # command: /install
  volumes:
   - ./confs/credentials.conf:/myconfig:ro

rest:
  user: root
  volumes:
    - ./confs/fixirodsclient.sh:/fix
  command: /fix
  links:
      # IRODS MUST BE CALLED rodserver
      - icat:rodserver

# To clean like there was no init:
# ./do clean
