# RAPyDO

A framework for writing REST API with Python in a Docker development/production environment.

## What this component is

This is the Rapydo framework base to be forked and (heavily) customized by your needs.
This is also called by us the `vanilla code`.

Note: all python packages from our framework can be found in Pypi with the `rapydo-` prefix:
