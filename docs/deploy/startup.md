# Start-up the project #

## 1. cloning ##

To clone the working code:

```bash
$ VERSION=1.1.2 \
    && git clone https://github.com/EUDAT-B2STAGE/http-api.git \
    && cd http-api \
    && git checkout $VERSION

#Â now you will have the current latest release
```

## 2. configure ##

Now that you have all necessary software installed, before launching services you should consider editing the configuration by creating a `.projectrc` and override here your own variables, i.e. at least the basic passwords, or configure access to external service (e.g. your own instance of iRODS/B2SAFE) for production.


## 3. controller

The controller is what let you manage the project without much effort.
Here's what you need to use it:

```bash
# install and use the rapydo controller
sudo pip3 install rapydo-controller
rapydo --project b2stage install auto
# you have now the executable 'rapydo'
$ rapydo --version
```

NOTE: python install binaries in `/usr/local/bin`. If you are not the admin/`root` user then the virtual environment is created and you may find the binary in `$HOME/.local/bin`. Make sure that the right one of these paths is in your `$PATH` variable, otherwise you end up with `command not found`.


## 4. deploy initialization

Your current project needs to be initialized. This step is needed only the first time you use the cloned repository.

```bash
$ rapydo --project b2stage init
```

If you wish to __**manually upgrade**__:

```bash
VERSION="1.1.2"
git checkout $VERSION

# supposely the rapydo framework has been updated, so you need to check:
rapydo init

# update docker images with the new build templates in rapydo
rapydo pull
```
