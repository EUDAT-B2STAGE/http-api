### squash branch

A better practice before pull requesting is to squash commits into a single one. Here's a guide on how to do so with git cli:

```bash
MYEXISTINGBRANCH='v0.1.0'
BASEBRANCH='master'

# start from the base branch (usually it's master)
git checkout $BASEBRANCH
# create a new branch for squashing
git checkout -b ${MYEXISTINGBRANCH}-squashed
# squash the differences between now and the feature branch
git merge --squash $MYEXISTINGBRANCH
# commit message will contain all commit messages so far
git commit
# you may/should change the content, at least top title and description
```
